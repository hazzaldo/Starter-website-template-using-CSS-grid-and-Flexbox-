# A starter website layout template (designed with CSS-grid and Flexbox). # 
==============================================================================
Developing a website from scratch can be tedious and long-winded - to build a layout from scratch using CSS, constantly tinkering with each element styling and position. In the past it's proven to be a considerably long-winded process for web developers, creating complex CSS files that over-time become difficult to manage and maintain, without using great website layout design tools and practises.  
Thus, I built a generic and common website starter template, using HTML, CSS-grid and Flexbox (the most up-to-date and best layout design frameworks for web development). 

The purpose of this project is of two reasons. The first, to create a generic starter layout template for rapid web development, that is very easy to manage and maintain, following a common website layout structure, consisting of: 
* A Nav bar (menu bar) 
* A Cover section (the attention-grabbing section - banners, promotions, main message ...etc) 
* A Grid section (for main content) 
* A Footer section. 
This template can be easily built upon, with further content, styling and layout customisation. Built using Flex-box and CSS-Grid - the two latest and best tools for web development layout design (as of 2018-2019). The second reason is to break the myth or misunderstanding that with the recent introduction of CSS-grid tool, many people began to compare CSS-grid vs Flexbox. The truth is, both are great tools that actually can work with and compliment each other. There's no one versus the other. So this project combines both tools and proves that combining both of them produces amazing results.
Please note, this is by no mean a finished website application, but simply a starter website layout template that skips the tediousness of developing a website layout from scratch, that is also easy to manage, maintain and build upon further content, layouts and styles for rapid web development. I also added a generic image, from a free image resource website, just to demonstrate how easy it is to add content on top of the layout template.
